Split orient into two parts. avoid() is now high level avoidance procedure.
Currently accomplishes detection and orientation.

Since we don't have a whiteboard, I figured this would be the next best
thing to share progress so we don't have to play catch-up every
time we work separately!

I reverted the autonomous method to a bunch of old commented code and
put operational arm control stuff into its own method and expanded on it.
Now we can have specific controls for the arm without impeding regular
opcontrols.
opcontrols.
-Wheel functionality is back in opcontrol
-The autonomous button we normally use now enters armControl (autonomous is
 unbound)
-While in armControl, the right button normally used to terminate will just
 exit armControl and not terminate the program (unless pressed a second time).

 Good luck, mydude.

Short-term Goals:
-Obstacle avoidance
-Obstacle dimension detection
  -Fixed sonar y-axis traversal
-More precise line tracking

Long-Term Goals:
-Relaying obstacle information to Skippy boi

  Made correction to avoidance class function axisTurnUntilFound(). Turns until
the current distance is greater than the previous distance. The idea being that
Bart will be aiming closer to the center of the object (in theory?) and so
he will not have to translate as many times.

        .. Problems to overcome with this ^ ..
  - How to tell when we are on the opposite side of the object, if we're trying
  to maneuver around the object. Or if we are trying to map it's total area,
  when do we arrive back to our original location?
  + For now we could just use the line trackers and always have the object on
  top of the line. That way when we are maneuvering around the object we can
  go until we find the line. For mapping object we can go until we encounter
  a second line .. the second line actually being the line we were initially on.
